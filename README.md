## Description
This application is designed to store information for an e-commerce company in a database and then, using api requests, return information in that database. My job in this project was to complete the back-end code, including the models and routes, to get the application to function as intended.

<br>

## Installation
MySql (mysql2), Express, Sequelize, and other dependencies (ex. dotenv) must be installed before trying to run application.
